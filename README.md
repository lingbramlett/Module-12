Module 12 Challenge â€“ NoSQL Analysis
In this challenge, MongoDB and Python were used to analyze data from various establishments across the United Kingdom.

The original dataset is stored in the Resources folder as establishments.json.

To prepare for the analysis, the database was modified to meet specific requirements. This setup process is documented in the Jupyter Notebook NoSQL_setup.ipynb.

Following the setup, data analysis was conducted to explore establishment ratings and other key insights. The findings are detailed in the Jupyter Notebook NoSQL_analysis.ipynb.
